## Pricing Model: Hybrid

**Flat base + outcome-based bonus.** Why hybrid? Pure usage-based (per email) incentivizes sending more, not better. Pure outcome-based (per meeting) creates unpredictable revenue. Hybrid aligns incentives: flat base covers infrastructure; outcome bonus rewards actual results.

## Three Tiers

## Anchoring Against Alternatives

| Alternative | Monthly Cost | Outcome |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Junior SDR (salary + tools) | $5,500-7,000/mo | 8-15 meetings/mo after 3-month ramp |
| Clay + Instantly + Apollo stack | $500-1,000/mo + 15-20 hrs/week founder time | Variable |
| Freelance SDR (Upwork) | $2,000-4,000/mo | Quality varies wildly |
| **Spear Growth** | **$399/mo + ~$125-250 meeting bonuses** | **5-12 meetings/mo, fully autonomous** |

:::tip[The math]
Spear Growth at $399/mo + ~$175 in meeting bonuses = ~$575/mo total for 7 meetings. That's **$82/meeting**. A junior SDR at $6K/mo booking 10 meetings costs **$600/meeting**. Spear is **7x cheaper per meeting.**

## Why the Outcome Bonus Works

The +$25/meeting bonus (capped at 2x base) creates several positive dynamics:

1. **Aligns incentives** — the system is optimized for meetings, not email volume
2. **Provides ROI proof** — customers can calculate exact cost per meeting
3. **Creates expansion revenue** — as the AI improves, more meetings = more revenue without adding customers
4. **Low risk for customers** — bonus only triggers when real value is delivered
