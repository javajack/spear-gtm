## The Step-by-Step Experience

<Steps>

1. **Sign up and connect your Google account** (2 minutes)
   One-click Google OAuth. We use this for email access and calendar availability.

2. **Paste your product URL and describe your ideal customer** (3 minutes)
   Just 2 sentences. Example: "We sell project management software to marketing agencies with 10-50 employees." The AI handles the rest.

3. **Connect your email** (1 minute)
   Gmail or Outlook via OAuth. Spear manages sending from your existing domain.

4. **Wait 4 hours** while the AI works
   Spear scrapes your product page, reverse-engineers your ICP, finds matching prospects, researches each one, and generates personalized email sequences.

5. **Review 25 researched prospects with draft outreach** (<15 minutes)
   Each prospect has: company summary, why they're a fit, personalization hooks, and a 3-email draft sequence. Approve, edit, or skip.

6. **Approve 10 with one click**
   Or edit any emails you want. The system learns your preferences.

7. **First emails hit inboxes the next morning**
   Sent at optimal times, throttled for deliverability, with proper authentication.

8. **First meeting booked within 2 weeks**
   When a prospect replies with interest, Spear drafts a response with your available meeting times. You approve with one click.

## The Feeling

:::tip[This is what we're building toward]
"I have an SDR working for me around the clock and it costs less than my Spotify + Netflix combined."

The founder went from "I spent 3 hours on LinkedIn and got zero responses" to having meetings appear on their calendar without lifting a finger.
