:::note[Why this segment is perfect for bootstrapping]
This segment is **price-sensitive but ROI-driven**, congregates in **identifiable communities** (free distribution), is **highly vocal** (word-of-mouth amplification), and has **low expectations** for enterprise features (fast time to market). Every attribute aligns with a bootstrapped go-to-market motion.
