## The Exclusion List

Saying "no" to features is harder than saying "yes." Every exclusion below was a deliberate choice to maximize launch speed and product quality.

| Excluded Feature | Why It's Excluded | When It's Added |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **CRM / deal management** | HubSpot free CRM or a spreadsheet is fine for &lt;$2M ARR. Adding CRM triples surface area and delays launch by months. | <Badge text="V2" variant="note" /> |
| **LinkedIn outreach automation** | LinkedIn aggressively bans automation. Legal and account risk too high for V1. | <Badge text="V2" variant="caution" /> (manual-assist model) |
| **Content marketing / SEO tools** | Different motion entirely. Founders who need pipeline NOW need outbound, not a 6-month content play. | Not planned |
| **Phone / cold calling** | Technical founders don't cold call. Their prospects don't answer unknown numbers. | Not planned |
| **Multi-channel orchestration** | V1 is email-only. Doing one channel excellently beats doing three channels poorly. | <Badge text="V3" variant="note" /> |
| **Team collaboration features** | Target customer is solo founder or 2-3 person team. No need for roles, approvals, or team analytics. | <Badge text="V3" variant="note" /> |
| **Custom integrations / API** | Build integrations when customers demand them, not before. V1 has Gmail, Outlook, and Google Calendar. That's it. | <Badge text="V3" variant="note" /> |

## The Discipline Principle

:::caution[The #1 startup killer]
Most startups die from building too much, not too little. Every feature added to V1 is:
- 1-2 weeks of development time
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- More surface area for bugs
- Slower iteration on what matters

V1 must nail **one thing**: booking meetings from cold outbound. Everything else is a distraction.

## Why Email Only in V1

The decision to focus exclusively on email is deliberate:

1. **Email is the most controllable channel** — we manage sending domains, deliverability, and timing
2. **Email has the best measurability** — open rates, reply rates, and meeting conversion are trackable
3. **Email doesn't risk account bans** — unlike LinkedIn automation
4. **Email scales linearly** — more prospects = more emails = more meetings, predictably
5. **Email data compounds** — subject lines, messaging patterns, and timing data all improve the AI

Multi-channel comes in V2/V3 after email-based outbound is demonstrably working.
