Imagine waking up to find three meeting requests on your calendar from prospects you've never heard of — people who are a perfect fit for your product. That's what Spear feels like. No cold calling, no LinkedIn grinding, no 15-hour weeks doing outbound. Just meetings appearing while you focus on building.

## One-Line Positioning

> **AI outbound agent that generates qualified pipeline for B2B SaaS founders — measured on meetings booked, not emails sent.**

## What Spear Does

Spear is an AI agent that handles the entire outbound motion for technical B2B SaaS founders. It replaces the need for:

- A junior SDR ($55-75K/year)
- A DIY tool stack ($500-1,000/mo + 15-20 hours/week)
- Sales expertise the founder doesn't have

## The Five Core Capabilities
