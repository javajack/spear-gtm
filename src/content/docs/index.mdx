## The Problem

Technical founders build great products that die because they can't generate enough pipeline. They can't afford an SDR ($55-75K/year), don't have time for manual outbound (15-20 hours/week), and existing tools assume deep sales expertise.

**Spear fixes this.** An AI agent that handles the entire outbound motion — from finding prospects to booking meetings — for $199-799/mo.

  <Card title="7x Cheaper Than an SDR" icon="approve-check">
    $82/meeting vs. $600/meeting for a junior SDR. AI handles 80% of what an SDR does at 1/100th the cost.

    Every email, reply, and meeting feeds cross-customer intelligence. Customer #500 gets dramatically better outreach than customer #1.

## Why This Is Contrarian But Right

The consensus says "AI SDR is crowded — 15+ funded startups, don't enter." Here's why the market is wrong:

| Aspect | Consensus View | Spear's Reality |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Market** | "AI SDR is crowded" | Crowded at horizontal mid-market. SaaS founder niche is unserved. |
| **Competition** | "VC-backed players win" | They target mid-market with $800+/mo tools. $200-500/mo segment is invisible to them. |
| **Product** | "It's just email automation" | The SDR is the wedge. The intelligence platform is the business. |
| **Distribution** | "You need a sales team" | SaaS founders are the most connected, vocal buyer segment in B2B. CAC approaches zero. |

## Revenue Trajectory
