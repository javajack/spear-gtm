## TL;DR

Most technical founders are great at building products but struggle to fill their pipeline. Spear is an AI agent that handles your entire outbound motion — finding prospects, writing personalized emails, and managing replies — so you get meetings on your calendar without becoming a full-time salesperson. It costs a fraction of hiring an SDR (Sales Development Rep), and it starts working in 30 minutes.

## The Problem

You've built something people need, but your calendar is empty. Hiring an SDR costs $55-75K/year (way too much at your stage), doing it yourself eats 15-20 hours a week, and every tool out there assumes you already know how to sell.

**Spear fixes this.** An AI agent that handles the entire outbound motion — from finding prospects to booking meetings — for $199-799/mo.

  <Card title="Autonomous Send + Reply" icon="rocket">
    Emails go out on schedule, replies get classified, interested prospects get a response draft — all with your approval. You stay in control without doing the work.

  <Card title="Pipeline Intelligence" icon="star">
    Weekly briefings on what's working, automatic A/B testing, and conversion metrics. The system learns from every email sent across all customers — so it keeps getting better.

  <Card title="7x Cheaper Than an SDR" icon="approve-check">
    $82 per meeting vs. $600 for a junior SDR. AI handles 80% of what an SDR does at a fraction of the cost.

  <Card title="Compounding Moat" icon="random">
    Every email, reply, and meeting feeds cross-customer intelligence. Customer #500 gets dramatically better outreach than customer #1 — and competitors can't replicate that data.

## Why Everyone Thinks We're Crazy (And Why They're Wrong)

The consensus says "AI SDR is crowded — 15+ funded startups, don't enter." Here's why the market is wrong:

| Aspect | Consensus View | Spear's Reality |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Market** | "AI SDR is crowded" | Crowded at horizontal mid-market. SaaS founder niche is unserved. |
| **Competition** | "VC-backed players win" | They target mid-market with $800+/mo tools. $200-500/mo segment is invisible to them. |
| **Product** | "It's just email automation" | The SDR is the wedge. The intelligence platform is the business. |
| **Distribution** | "You need a sales team" | SaaS founders are the most connected, vocal buyer segment in B2B. CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) approaches zero. |

## Where This Is Headed

Spear starts as your AI SDR, but that's just the beginning. By Month 12, the intelligence and relationship data it accumulates positions it as a full GTM platform — one where the AI actually runs your go-to-market instead of giving you a dashboard full of empty fields.
